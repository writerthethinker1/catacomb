# Readme: Catacomb Project

This is the official readme for the catacomb project. This project helps ensure that the Earth, this realm, is healthy and can support superpowers for everyone in it. It is sealed by liQuidYarn and is approved Universally for commercial and industrial use. This project was put into effect after various people pushed forward a giant message that the planet was sick and that it is not comfortable at all being in certain locations on Earth. Some regions on this planet are so that no one can use any power, jutsus, etc...and this led to worry about food, water, health, and safety. So, I, Ramneek Narayan, was commissioned on their behalf to construct a catacomb over the entire planet Earth so it could be healthy again. In turn, this repo is about manually editing the planet and having a record so that the Earth can support jutsus and magick again. During Buddha ªs days, there was power and since then, it has been a long time. We as liQuidYarn hope to bring back an era of the Buddhas where powers are here for everyone on planet Earth.

Thank You
